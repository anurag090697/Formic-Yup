# Sign-Up Form with Formik and Yup

This project demonstrates a simple and robust sign-up form built with React, utilizing Formik for form management and Yup for form validation. The form includes fields for name, email, password, and password confirmation, ensuring that all user input meets specified validation criteria. The form is hosted on Vercel.

## Features

- **Formik** for form management, including field handling, validation, and submission.
- **Yup** for schema validation, ensuring correct input formats and values.
- Real-time validation feedback with inline error messages.
- Automatically clears input fields upon successful submission.

## Form Validation

The form consists of four fields:
- **Name**: Required, with a minimum length of 2 characters and a maximum of 25 characters.
- **Email**: Required, must be a valid email format.
- **Password**: Required, must exactly match `Sleep@247`.
- **Confirm Password**: Required, must match the password field.

The submit button is disabled until all fields are valid.
